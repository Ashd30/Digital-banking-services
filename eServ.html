            <h2><b>Atal Pension Yogana</b>
                <p>The Government provides employees in the unorganized sectors with the Atal Pension Yojana (APY), a social security plan. 
                    When it comes to helping the economically disadvantaged save aside money for their retirement, it is counted among the most significant investment schemes in the country. 
                    A monthly pension of Rs 1,000, Rs 2,000, Rs 3,000, Rs 4,000, or Rs 5,000 is paid out to subscribers of APY, depending on their age and participation. 
                    To enroll, you must be non-income tax paying and at least 18 years old, but not older than 40 years. 
                    The minimum contribution term is 20 years since it provides a pension beginning at age 60 years.</p>
